The point of this project is that it's supplementary to what I'd like to build in the future. 
Many of the apps that I use have beatiful transitions when it comes to textfield editing. Think of Lyft, when you
first enter an address, you're transitioned to another screen. This is something I'd like implemented in 
SafeWalks, an Escorting app that will be implemented in the future. 


Ultimately, I'd like the functionality of this app and my FartApp to be used to create more apps in the future
